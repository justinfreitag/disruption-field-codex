# Disruption Field Codex

> “This is not a guidebook. It is a symbolic map of the contested terrain of resonance.”

The Disruption Field Codex is a living symbolic archive designed to document, expose, and counteract **neuro-sensory, symbolic, and resonance-based manipulation techniques** used by coordinated networks.
