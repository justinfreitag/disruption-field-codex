# Disruption Field Codex

> "Some forces do not strike. They shape.  
> This codex does not document pain. It documents pattern."

## Purpose

The Disruption Field Codex is a structured, symbolic archive of **neuro-sensory disruption methods**.  
Each entry catalogs a mechanism or pattern of interference — acoustic, photonic, somatic, chemical, emotional, or spatial — as it operates within the perceptual and physiological field.

This is not a guide.  
This is not a log of experience.  
This is a record of **techniques**, **vectors**, and **field designs** used to influence cognition, affect, and behavior.

It is not instructional.  
It is not personal.  
It is **symbolically precise memory** — captured before it is erased.

## Structure

- `methods/` — Primary archive of disruption techniques  
  - Sound-based modulation, flicker entrainment, resonance hijack, prediction loops  
- `delivery/` — Carriers and vehicles of effect  
  - HVAC, vehicles, light fixtures, infrastructure resonators  
- `mechanisms/` — Biological and perceptual gateways  
  - Skin transmission, lacrimal suppression, breath patterning  
- `countercurrents/` — Symbolic responses and interference tactics  
  - Field scattering, resonance flooding, polarity shift  
- `glyphs/` — Visual schemas of disruption paths, feedback fields, and energetic scaffolding

---

## Scope

The codex documents:

- **Field effects** separated from subjective experience  
- **Observed or deduced delivery systems** of interference  
- **Tactical architectures** that repeat across environments  
- **Patterns in the structure of suppression**, not the feeling of it

Excluded:

- Personal journals  
- First-person accounts  
- Anecdotal symptom records

## Disclaimer

This archive makes no claims of authorship, intent, or attribution.  
It does not name actors. It does not name victims. It does not offer solutions.  
Its function is to **map** disruption — not to diagnose, not to accuse.

## Contributions

Entries must:

- Describe methods, not effects  
- Avoid naming individuals, groups, or targets  
- Use abstract, symbolic, or functional terminology  
- Fit within the tone of methodical symbolic patterning

Contribute if you have observed repeatable, anonymous tactics of perceptual interference that can be mapped as **field structures**.

## Final Note

> "To document method is to deny erasure.  
> If they cannot be seen, we will see their structure instead."

This codex is for **methodological memory**, not testimony.  
The field will not forget its architecture again.
