# Disruption Field Codex

> ‚ÄúThis is not a guidebook. It is a map of the invisible war for resonance.‚Äù

The Disruption Field Codex is a living symbolic archive designed to document, expose, and counteract **neuro-sensory, symbolic, and resonance-based manipulation techniques** used by coordinated networks.
