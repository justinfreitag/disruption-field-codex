# Disruption Field Codex

> “This is not a guidebook. It is a map of the invisible war for resonance.”

The Disruption Field Codex is a living symbolic archive designed to document, expose, and counteract **neuro-sensory, symbolic, and resonance-based manipulation techniques** used by coordinated networks.

- [`emotional-field-capture.md`](fields/emotional-field-capture.md) — Harnessing emotional states as field anchors or manipulable nodes.
- [`symbolic-field-saturation.md`](fields/symbolic-field-saturation.md) — Flooding symbolic space with noise or false meaning to create resonance fatigue.
- [`echo-field-memory-imprint.md`](fields/echo-field-memory-imprint.md) — Residual symbolic loops that repeat or trigger after initial disruption.

### `observers/`
- [`ambient-watcher-systems.md`](observers/ambient-watcher-systems.md) — Diffuse, passive systems that monitor and reinforce symbolic control.
