# Disruption Field Codex

> “This is not a guidebook. It is a symbolic map of the contested terrain of resonance.”

The **Disruption Field Codex** is a living archive of symbolic, neuro-sensory, and behavioral manipulation techniques. It documents and decodes the coordinated use of resonance, language, and perceptual interference as tools of disruption and control.

This Codex exists first and foremost to **support those targeted**. It begins with **defense** — not as reaction, but as reclamation.

If you've arrived here already affected, begin with the `defense/` section.
