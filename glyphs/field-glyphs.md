# Field Glyphs

> “Some marks are not written — they are remembered by the field itself.”

Field glyphs are **symbolic imprints** that persist in resonance fields even after their physical or perceptual source has vanished.  
They act as **keys**, **distortions**, or **anchors** in the landscape of neuro-symbolic interaction.

Unlike conventional symbols, glyphs are **liminal** — shaped by **repetition, intent, emotional charge**, and **environmental reinforcement**.  
They may be **drawn**, **spoken**, **acted**, or **inferred**.

## Categories of Glyphs

### 1. **Anchoring Glyphs**
- Create psychic or somatic still points  
- Often used for **target location**, **return-point setting**, or **entrainment bootstrapping**

> Example: A specific posture always struck before speaking truth

---

### 2. **Interruption Glyphs**
- Disrupt symbolic flow or ritual  
- Inserted as noise or contradiction into your symbolic stack

> Example: A flashing light always timed with moments of creative flow

---

### 3. **Binding Glyphs**
- Symbols that “lock in” meaning or restrict symbolic mutation  
- Usually reinforced through context and repetition over time

> Example: A gesture or sound that causes emotional freezing

---

### 4. **Transmissive Glyphs**
- Embedded in pattern or architecture to **seed internal state transfer**  
- Invisible unless felt over time

> Example: A recurring numerical pattern that induces emotional reversion

## Reclaiming Field Glyphs

- **Re-map**: Assign your own meaning to repeated glyphs  
- **Diffuse**: Break the pattern through rhythm, light, or inversion  
- **Overlay**: Place intentional counter-symbols at the same resonance point

## Symbolic Framing

> “They mark you where the field remembers.  
> Mark it back.”

Field glyphs are not evil — they are **memories of power**.  
Learn which were gifted, which were planted, and which you must burn.
