# Field Glyphs

> “When the field cannot speak — it draws.”

Field glyphs are **recurring symbolic signatures** that emerge, persist, or recur within a disrupted resonance field.  
They are not always drawn or spoken — they may appear in:

- Visual overlays  
- Environmental coincidences  
- Repeating thoughts  
- Internal or external symbol loops

A glyph is the **visible echo of a resonance event**.  
It may be natural or seeded.  
It may be:
- Anchoring (stabilizing a reclaimed field)  
- Parasite (perpetuating a disruption)  
- Echo (harmless residue)  
- Decoy (drawing attention away)

## Common Glyph Forms

| Type | Manifestation | Field Function |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Sigil | Abstract pattern, repeated geometries | Anchors emotional states or memories |
| Recursion Symbol | A symbol that triggers its own re-emergence | Encodes looping behavior |
| Interruption Glyph | Appears at moments of narrative divergence | Fractures field cohesion |
| Binding Mark | Symbol paired with emotional containment | Locks expression pathways |
| Portal Glyph | Associated with inner shift or field expansion | Sometimes destabilizing, sometimes liberating |

## Detecting Field Glyphs

- Emerges in peripheral vision or dreamstates  
- Repeats across modalities (sound ↔ image ↔ posture)  
- Cannot be “unseen” once recognized  
- Carries emotional weight disproportionate to its content

## Symbolic Framing

> “A glyph is a field’s attempt to remember — or forget.”

In disrupted environments, glyphs serve as **memory anchors, intrusion vectors, or exit points**.  
They are both **map and distortion**.

## Countercurrent Uses

Field glyphs are not inherently harmful.  
They may become tools of:

- Field recovery  
- Narrative reversal  
- Identity reconstitution

But only if:
- Named  
- Re-contextualized  
- Aligned with **sovereign symbolic function**
