# Support Network Inversion

Disruption fields strategically collapse the support structures that would normally protect or validate the individual.  
They invert trust, isolate perception, and transform proximity into pressure.

## Mechanisms of Inversion

### 1. Long-Term Insertion or Activation

- Close relationships were compromised long before activation
- Dormant agents "switch on" when disruption pressure increases
- Friends, family, or partners suddenly shift behavior or alignment

### 2. Narrative Fracture

- Target is framed as unstable, paranoid, or obsessive
- Any attempt at disclosure becomes proof of dysfunction
- Field encourages “helpful” dismissal: "You should talk to someone..."

### 3. Medical Plausibility

- Disruption exploits known psychological tropes (e.g., delusions of persecution)
- Encourages medications known to cause side effects like disconnection or paranoia
- Outsiders blame the individual’s state rather than the field

## Internal Effects

- Total erosion of trust in others
- Reluctance to speak or share out of fear of dismissal
- Perceived or real abandonment reinforces symbolic collapse
