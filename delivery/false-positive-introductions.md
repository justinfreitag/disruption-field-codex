# False Positive Introductions

## Overview
A subtle but highly effective tactic is the introduction of individuals who are not actually part of the disruption group. These people are unaware of the group’s intentions but are woven into staged encounters to create a sense of normalcy and legitimacy.  

The effect is twofold: it muddies the distinction between true actors and bystanders, and it reinforces the narrative that everything unfolding is “just ordinary social interaction.”

## Method
1. **Selection of Outsiders**  
   Unaware locals, acquaintances, or community members are chosen because of their credibility or perceived neutrality. Their involvement is incidental — they are not “in on it.”

2. **Staged Proximity**  
   These outsiders are invited into the same setting as the target — at a dinner, during a walk, or as part of a social group. Their presence legitimizes the event.

3. **Narrative Reinforcement**  
   If the target later questions the encounter, the presence of outsiders provides cover: “Look, it was just an ordinary gathering. Nothing unusual.”

4. **Confusion as a Tool**  
   The target is left uncertain who is acting deliberately and who is unaware. This uncertainty itself becomes a form of disruption.

## Effects
- **Creates Plausible Deniability**: Outsiders act as shields for disruptors.  
- **Destabilizes Perception**: Makes it difficult for the target to discern friend from actor.  
- **Strengthens Narrative Control**: Social staging appears normal, even supportive, when viewed from outside.  

## Notes
This tactic leverages trust in ordinary social participation. Outsiders remain unknowing participants in a broader system of symbolic disruption.
