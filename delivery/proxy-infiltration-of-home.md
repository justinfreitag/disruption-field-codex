# Proxy Infiltration of Home

## Overview
A recurring tactic involves embedding actors into domestic spaces under the guise of social or community interaction. This is not overt intrusion but a staged sequence designed to normalize presence in the home.

## Stages of Infiltration
1. **Casual Encounter**  
   Contact is initiated through routine, low-risk interactions — a dog walk, a neighborly wave, a casual chat. The initial framing is harmless and unthreatening.

2. **Social Invitation**  
   The actor extends an invitation to a larger group setting — a dinner, a community event, or a local activity. This moves the contact from incidental to intentional.

3. **Normalization of Presence**  
   The individual begins visiting the home under the pretense of friendship, hospitality, or support. Repetition reframes intrusion as care.

4. **Service Embedding**  
   The presence deepens when practical support is introduced: trades, favors, or "help" that legitimizes further access. The household may become dependent on these roles.

5. **Reframing**  
   Over time, what began as infiltration is positioned as *support*. Intrusion is masked as community and helpfulness. The boundary between private and external collapses.

## Effects
- **Narrative Control**: Home becomes a symbolic extension of the field.  
- **Trust Manipulation**: Household members are positioned differently — some aware of intrusion, others seeing only community.  
- **Vulnerability Creation**: By embedding into intimate space, disruptors gain influence that is more difficult to resist than external pressure.  

## Notes
This method thrives on plausible deniability. Each step can be dismissed as “friendship” or “help,” but together they establish a sustained vector of symbolic control.
