# Vehicular and Pedestrian Patterning

Movement in public space becomes a medium for symbolic reinforcement.  
Disruption fields exploit traffic—both vehicular and human—to simulate attention, induce paranoia, and reflect symbolic cues.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Vehicle-Based Patterning

- Timed drive-bys with specific colors, models, or plate patterns
- Engine revving, horn taps, or light flashes synchronized with emotional peaks
- Parking placements (e.g., white SUV visible every morning upon exit)

### 2. Pedestrian Symbol Mirroring

- Walkers placed with mirrored posture, clothing colors, or expressions
- Seemingly casual overheard conversations that mirror inner dialogue or past decisions
- "Chance" encounters near symbolic trigger locations (e.g., gym entrance)

## Real-World Effects

- Builds the impression of being watched or talked about
- Reinforces symbolic self-doubt (“Am I imagining this?”)
- Creates a dissonance loop between sensory input and narrative coherence

---

## Strategic Outcomes

- Destabilization of public movement
- Suppression of exploration and unpredictability
- Training toward fixed routes or isolation
