# Directional Sound Deployment

Sound can be spatially targeted using directional audio technologies, allowing messages or tonal cues to be delivered to an individual without others nearby perceiving them. This creates the illusion of internal origin or selective targeting.

### Technologies Used

- **Ultrasonic Beamforming** — Projects audible sound via modulated ultrasonic carriers, demodulated by the air or body.
- **Parametric Speakers** — Devices that emit sound in a narrow beam, often inaudible outside a tight field.
- **Bone Conduction** — Tones delivered via structural surfaces (furniture, windows, walls) directly into the skull.

### Applications

- Delivering symbolic or mnemonic content without public awareness.
- Creating plausible deniability ("no one else heard it").
- Inducing psychological destabilization (e.g., voices, phantom sounds).
- Supporting scripted interactions (e.g., cueing a target before engagement).

### Key Effects

- **Isolated Perception** — Target believes no one else hears what they do.
- **Symbolic Overlay** — Sounds carry encoded meanings built up over repeated use.
- **Gaslighting Mechanism** — Others are unaware, creating doubt in the target's own experience.

Directional sound creates intimate, field-bound communication channels—used not for comfort, but for disorientation, coercion, and control.
