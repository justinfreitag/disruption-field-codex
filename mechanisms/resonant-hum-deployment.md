# Resonant Hum Deployment

Low-frequency hums—often just below conscious awareness—are deployed to influence mood, physiology, and cognition. These resonant hums act as environmental modifiers that saturate spaces with persistent influence.

### Characteristics

- **Frequency Range**: 30–120 Hz commonly observed.
- **Modulation**: Amplitude or frequency-modulated to embed patterns.
- **Duration**: Can be continuous or pulsed over extended periods.

### Primary Effects

- **Physiological Entrapment** — Induces fatigue, nausea, or tension.
- **Emotional Modulation** — Alters baseline mood, increases irritability or depression.
- **Cognitive Interference** — Disrupts focus, induces brain fog, undermines verbal recall.

### Delivery Methods

- **Structural Vibration** — Transmitted through walls, floors, or furniture.
- **HVAC Systems** — Used to distribute low-frequency tones throughout buildings.
- **Ground Coupling** — Tones transmitted through building foundations or plumbing systems.

### Strategic Use

- Creates a field baseline of discomfort or dissonance.
- Weakens internal coherence, increasing susceptibility to scripted interactions.
- Can be synchronized with symbolic content or directional audio for greater effect.

These hums are not mistakes or malfunctions—they are engineered conditions designed to prime the nervous system for disruption.
