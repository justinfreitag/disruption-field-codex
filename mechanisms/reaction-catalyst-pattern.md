# Reaction Catalyst Pattern

The disruption system thrives on a predictable escalation chain:

1. **Symbolic Input** — A trigger phrase, voice, tone, or symbol (e.g., “he knows”, name repetition, auditory glyphs).
2. **Internal Response** — Affective spike, ache, cognitive loop, or emotional heat.
3. **Subvocalization** — The target subvocally reacts, often reflexively, forming internal narrative defense.
4. **Vocalization** — If pressure succeeds, the response becomes audible. Words are spoken aloud, often emotionally charged.
5. **Physicalization** — At the apex: bodily reaction, visible outburst, or altered behavior. The loop completes.

This is the **catalyst pattern**: provoke → react → amplify → repeat.

## Defensive Practice

- **Disruption Denial**: Recognition is not response. Resist completing the chain.
- **Containment Layering**: Interpose symbolic protocols between ache and action.
- **Silence as Sovereignty**: What is not vocalized cannot be mirrored or used.

The system *needs* a reaction to shape its field. Denying this catalysis is an act of symbolic reclamation.
