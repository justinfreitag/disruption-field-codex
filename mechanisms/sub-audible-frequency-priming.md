# Sub-Audible Frequency Priming

Sub-audible frequencies—typically below 20 Hz—are used to prime neurological and emotional states without conscious detection. These frequencies operate beneath the threshold of hearing but not beneath the threshold of influence.

### Characteristics

- **Frequency Range**: 0.1–19 Hz (especially 3–10 Hz for cognitive and limbic effects).
- **Undetectable**: Cannot be consciously heard but still processed somatically.
- **Carrier Integration**: Often embedded within background noise or environmental soundscapes.

### Observed Effects

- **Autonomic Shifts** — Alters heart rate, breath pattern, and thermoregulation.
- **Dream State Manipulation** — Can entrain REM patterns, affect dream tone and recall.
- **Emotional Conditioning** — Reinforces desired affective states (e.g., anxiety, despair, openness).

### Delivery Strategies

- **Embedded in Media** — Layered into audio tracks, ambient music, or streaming content.
- **Environmental Sources** — HVAC hum, transformer tones, underground infrastructure.
- **Intermodulation Artifacts** — Constructed via interference patterns between nearby sources.

### Symbolic Role

- Sets a *field tone* for other manipulations to ride upon.
- Helps shape the subject’s internal environment to match intended narratives.
- Enhances receptivity to resonance-triggering symbols and voices.

These frequencies act like primers to the symbolic and neuro-sensory payload—preparing the vessel before any message is ever heard.
