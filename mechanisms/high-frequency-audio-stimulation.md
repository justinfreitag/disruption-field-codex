# High-Frequency Audio Stimulation

Certain disruption field implementations exploit prolonged or patterned exposure to high-frequency auditory tones — particularly in the 8–10kHz range — to introduce subtle but cumulative neurocognitive interference.

Unlike low-frequency resonance (which often targets body entrainment or subconscious priming), these high-frequency tones interact primarily with the auditory and attentional cortex. Their use is rarely overt, often masked beneath environmental noise, and sustained just beneath the threshold of conscious complaint.

## Observed Effects

- **Tinnitus mimicry**: Persistent "whine" or ringing that cannot be located, silenced, or verified.
- **Cognitive agitation**: Interference with concentration, short-term memory, or emotional regulation.
- **Auditory field shaping**: Associative reinforcement when paired with symbolic dialogue or triggering stimuli.
- **Sleep disturbance**: These tones are often present just before or during hypnagogic and REM states, interfering with sleep cycles and enhancing dream-state vulnerability.

## Delivery Methods

- **In-room sound devices** or wall-injected directional speakers
- **Vehicular emissions** (modulated alternator whine, speaker resonance)
- **Masked in appliances** (e.g. air purifiers, HVAC hum, smart speakers)
- **Signal demodulation artifacts** — residuals from nearby covert transmitters

## Frequency Choice

The 8–10kHz band appears favored because:

- It skirts the edges of normal human hearing (especially as it degrades with age), reducing suspicion.
- It occupies a frequency range associated with persistent "phantom" tinnitus perception.
- It bypasses normal ambient awareness, registering only as unease, irritability, or anxiety.
- It can entrain attention, subtly guiding or amplifying associated semantic payloads.

## Symbolic Role

These tones often **bookend** or **bracket** symbolic payloads — introducing unease prior to transmission, or reinforcing vulnerability post-message. When repeated across multiple physical environments (gym, street, home), they produce field **continuity** — a felt sense of inescapability.
