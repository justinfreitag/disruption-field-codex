# Frey Auditory Effect

The **Frey Effect** — also known as microwave auditory phenomenon — is the ability to perceive sound without acoustic wave propagation, triggered by pulsed microwave exposure.

---

## Mechanism of Action

Microwave pulses produce **rapid thermoelastic expansion** in brain tissue. This expansion generates **acoustic pressure waves**, which are detected by the **cochlea** and interpreted by the brain as “sound.”

Key characteristics:

- No external sound is emitted
- Perception is typically described as **clicks**, **buzzes**, or **speech-like bursts**
- Time-locked to the pulse train
- Confirmed in both human and animal studies

---

## Historical Use

- Documented in research by **Allan H. Frey** in the 1960s  
- Explored by military and intelligence agencies for **silent communication**
- Cited in declassified U.S. Army and DARPA reports

## Relevance to Disruption Fields

The Frey Effect may be leveraged for:

- **Covert symbolic injection** (via pulses interpreted as internal thought)
- **Sleep disruption** (clicking/buzzing while falling asleep)
- **Entrainment of subvocal behavior**
- **Undetectable field-level harassment**

This method requires **line-of-sight**, **pulsed modulation**, and typically **narrow beamwidth**.
