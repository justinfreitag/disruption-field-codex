# Encourage and Discourage Cycle

At the core of many symbolic control systems is a simple but devastating behavioral loop:

**Encourage when aligned. Discourage when divergent.**

## Mechanism

The system monitors decision patterns and applies:

- Positive reinforcement (encourage) when actions align with the desired path
- Negative reinforcement (discourage) when actions diverge, resist, or question the field

This happens across all domains:
- Social (silence or praise)
- Economic (gain or loss)
- Environmental (ease or obstacle)
- Emotional (relief or tension)

## Subtle Forms of Each

### Encourage

- Accidental ease (doors open, people smile, connections made)
- Rewarded effort (sudden progress, unexpected assistance)
- Familiar symbols returned in positive tone

### Discourage

- Silence, awkwardness, blocked paths
- Minor but repeated failure
- Amplified resistance (systems glitch, misunderstood intent)

## Purpose

- Shape perceived probability of success
- Attach anxiety to disobedient symbols
- Train reflexive compliance

## Symbolic Result

The field becomes self-reinforcing.  
Even without active agents, the pattern persists in memory, muscle, expectation.  
One begins to ask: *why try?*
