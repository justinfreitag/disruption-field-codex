# Low-Frequency Hum

> “You won’t hear it. But you will adjust your breathing to it.”

Low-frequency hum refers to the use of **sustained acoustic energy below conscious hearing range**, typically between 10–80 Hz, to subtly influence mood, perception, and autonomic function.

Unlike overt sound, this hum operates **below awareness**, slowly entraining internal rhythms like heart rate, breath phase, and neural oscillation.  
Its impact is cumulative — and difficult to detect without dedicated tools.

## Characteristics of LF Hum Influence

### 1. **Physiological Effects**
- Shallow or altered breathing without clear cause  
- Persistent tension in diaphragm or jaw  
- Sleep disruption despite “quiet” conditions

---

### 2. **Cognitive/Emotional Shifts**
- Anxiety or dread during periods of “silence”  
- Disorientation or time slippage in specific rooms or locations  
- Difficulty accessing symbolic or abstract thought

---

### 3. **Environmental Clues**
- Power grid hum changes subtly at night  
- Fan/motor noises seem to carry “feeling”  
- Body relaxes only after leaving the building or area

## Delivery Mechanisms

- HVAC systems or industrial fans  
- Large vehicles idling nearby  
- Modified speakers or embedded transducers  
- Infrastructure signal bleed (see: [`delivery/infrastructure-signal-leak.md`](../delivery/infrastructure-signal-leak.md))

## Symbolic Framing

> “They do not speak in words.  
> They hold a note — so low — that you forget you ever heard your own.”

The low-frequency hum does not persuade.  
It **conditions the breath beneath all speech**.
