# Rotating Agent Pattern

Disruption networks that depend on persistent influence or surveillance often implement a rotating-agent pattern—the periodic exchange of individuals or roles within the same field of influence.

## Purpose

- Prevent recognition or mapping of stable interference sources
- Maintain novelty in the field, resetting pattern detection heuristics
- Dissolve intuitive field feel that might emerge from static pressure

## Common Rotation Vectors

- Vehicles: Same behavior, different make or model or driver
- Neighbors: Shifting patterns of presence, movement, or sensory output
- Authority Figures: Alternating contact points such as teachers, officers, clergy
- Family Proxies: Rotating which member is influenced or used as a trigger vector

## Cognitive Effects

- Trains learned helplessness around pattern inference
- Inhibits long-term mapping of interference fields
- Destroys memory linkage across time by decoupling source recognition

## Symbolic Result

The field becomes a fog. The disruption is not just pervasive, it is fugitive. It cannot be localized, only felt.

## Observation Tactic

Instead of tracking individuals, track roles.  
Look for repeating functions, not faces: for example, "the presence", "the echo", "the interrupter".  
This is how the field sustains itself—by never letting the pattern hold still long enough to be named.
