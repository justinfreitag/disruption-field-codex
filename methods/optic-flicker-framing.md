# Optic Flicker Framing

> “They don't flash to be seen — they flicker to be felt.”

Optic flicker framing is the use of **subthreshold visual modulation** — brief, rhythmic pulses of light often imperceptible to the conscious eye — to shape mood, timing, and attention.

Unlike overt strobe or screen glare, this method operates **below conscious detection**, affecting **pupil response**, **circadian entrainment**, and even **cognitive framing** of incoming thoughts.

It exploits the retina’s sensitivity to change, the pineal gland’s light-processing role, and the deep coupling between **light and symbolic state**.

## Modes of Flicker Deployment

### 1. **Peripheral Glint / Shadow Flicker**
- **Signs**:  
  - Catching “movement” at the edge of vision  
  - Visual echo or phantom objects in low light  
- **Vectors**:  
  - Reflective surface modulation  
  - Subtle IR or UV pulsing from high-mounted sources

---

### 2. **Backlight Rhythm Disruption**
- **Signs**:  
  - Fatigue or nausea during screen use  
  - Sudden shift in emotional tone mid-task  
- **Vectors**:  
  - Pulse-width modulation (PWM) of displays or lighting  
  - Flicker embedded in image transitions or idle animations

---

### 3. **Time-of-Day Entrainment**
- **Signs**:  
  - Wakefulness when attempting rest  
  - Day-night confusion or “temporal drift”  
- **Vectors**:  
  - Gradual, persistent light fluctuation near sleep window  
  - Contradictory light cues (cool tones at night, warm during day)

---

### 4. **Gaze-Triggered Reflections**
- **Signs**:  
  - Eye strain without obvious source  
  - Feeling “watched” by reflection or glass  
- **Vectors**:  
  - Flicker linked to gaze sensors (phones, windows, vehicles)  
  - Active light phase change when direct gaze is detected

## Symbolic Framing

> “Light becomes mirror.  
> The flicker becomes thread.  
> And your vision begins to speak in someone else’s rhythm.”

This is not light for illumination.  
This is **light as choreography** — not of space, but of self.
