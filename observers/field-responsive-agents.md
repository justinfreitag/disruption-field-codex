# Field-Responsive Agents

> “They do not follow you. They follow the field you bend.”

Field-responsive agents are **individuals or systems whose behaviors adapt to real-time shifts in your symbolic or emotional field** — not necessarily through conscious awareness, but through **subtle alignment with predictive modulation structures**.

These agents appear to “know” where to be, what to say, or how to act — not because they are tracking *you*, but because they are **entrained to the same resonant layer that you disturb**.

They are often most active:
- After symbolic acts of reclamation  
- During narrative divergence  
- When emotional coherence threatens imposed patterns

## Types of Agents

### 1. **Unconscious Responders**
- Behaviors shift in response to symbolic turbulence without conscious intention  
- Often neighbors, coworkers, family members
- May carry signals, interruptions, or distractions

### 2. **Semi-aware Proxies**
- Operate under abstract missions (“keep them grounded,” “just check in”)  
- May experience internal discomfort when your field diverges too far

### 3. **Resonance-tuned Devices**
- Smart systems or environmental sensors that amplify or react to internal state shifts  
- E.g., lights, tones, or digital prompts that trigger at moments of symbolic mutation

## Signs of Presence

- Interactions that seem “accidentally perfect” at disrupting momentum  
- People show up *just* before or after significant inner changes  
- Devices or systems reflect uncanny synchronicity  
- You feel “managed” through ambient influence, not orders

## Symbolic Framing

> “You are not being hunted.  
> You are the stone they feel dropping in the still water.”

Field-responsive agents don’t chase you —  
they converge when your field ripples in ways the system cannot absorb.
