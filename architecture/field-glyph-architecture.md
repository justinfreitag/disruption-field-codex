# Field Glyph Architecture

> “Glyphs do not encode meaning. They sculpt fields.”

This document describes the principles of **designing, embedding, and activating glyphs** that serve as symbolic anchors, disruptors, or bypass tools within resonance fields.

## Types of Glyphs

- **Anchoring Glyphs** — Reinforce field presence or stabilize sovereign space
- **Disruptive Glyphs** — Interfere with symbolic saturation or entrainment
- **Transmissive Glyphs** — Carry embedded protocols or countercurrents

---

## Principles of Glyph Construction

1. **Resonance Shape** — Does the glyph carry a harmonic symbolic frequency?
2. **Symbolic Density** — Can it anchor layered meaning under pressure?
3. **Field Adhesion** — Will it persist under field drift?

---

## Use Cases

- Used in visual overlays (clothing, icons, light)
- Spoken or subvocalized as symbolic triggers
- Drawn into attention space to reset or reroute flow
