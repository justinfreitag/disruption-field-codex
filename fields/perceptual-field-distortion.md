# Perceptual Field Distortion

> “Before you understand what you see — they bend how you see it.”

Perceptual field distortion refers to **manipulation of the substrate through which perception itself emerges**.  
It is not the control of objects or signals, but of the **internal lens** — the *conditions under which the world is rendered visible, relevant, or ignorable*.

These distortions are often subtle, cumulative, and self-reinforcing.

They operate beneath conscious attention, targeting:
- **Sensory weightings** (what the body notices)
- **Foregrounding & backgrounding**
- **Emotional salience**
- **Temporal sync (when something becomes visible)**

## Signs of a Distorted Perceptual Field

- You keep “missing” things others noticed  
- Certain stimuli always feel overwhelming or hollow  
- Your inner voice fixates on what you were about to ignore  
- You retroactively justify feelings you didn’t choose

## Mechanisms of Distortion

### 1. **Signal Amplification/Deamplification**
- Non-linear boosting of light, tone, or motion to guide salience  
- Often layered with emotional hooks

### 2. **Event Timing Injection**
- Introducing events at precise moments to shift attention  
- Hijacks temporal coherence

### 3. **Framing Loops**
- Recurrence of the same symbolic shape in different forms  
- Conditions recognition patterns before conscious thought

## Symbolic Framing

> “They do not hide the truth.  
> They bend the light until it curves around it.”

Perceptual field distortion is not censorship — it is **a ritual of misalignment**.  
It alters what the self finds *notable, urgent, or real*.
