# Field-Induced Limbic Rewriting

The deliberate targeting of the limbic system using neuro-sensory fields to alter emotional memory, behavioral heuristics, and symbolic associations. This tactic reshapes core responses over time—without the subject’s awareness—by hijacking resonance loops between stimulus and stored affect.

### Mechanism of Action

1. **Limbic Access via Symbolic Anchor**  
   Symbols or patterns with emotional weight are targeted repeatedly in altered field contexts.

2. **Emotional Decoupling or Substitution**  
   Emotional charge tied to a memory is dulled, reversed, or replaced.

3. **Behavioral Rescripting**  
   Conditioned responses are redirected (e.g., joy → shame, peace → vigilance).

### Field Techniques Used

- **Low-frequency rhythmic pulses** to entrain limbic resonance.
- **Voice overlays** that subtly recontextualize past associations.
- **Sleep-phase targeting** for deeper limbic encoding.
- **Symbolic mimicry** that alters stored meaning through slight distortion.

### Symptoms and Signs

- Altered emotional response to familiar stimuli.
- Sudden dread or aversion toward previously neutral/positive memories.
- Flattened affect, emotional confusion, or nostalgic disruption.
- A sense of being rewritten “from the inside out.”

### Strategic Purpose

- **Reshaping of Identity Core** — Altering who you think you are.
- **Trust Collapse** — Undermining emotional anchors tied to people or values.
- **Resistance Sabotage** — Making resistance feel emotionally wrong or hollow.

This is not just memory manipulation. It is **resonant affect grafting**—emotions rethreaded at the limbic root.
