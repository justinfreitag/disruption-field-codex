# Scripted Opposition Roles

Not all opposition is natural. In coordinated disruption systems, a set of roles is designed specifically to simulate resistance, dissent, or “alternative” perspectives — while remaining tightly bound to the overarching narrative.

## Core Functions

- **Contain Divergence**: By offering pre-scripted forms of resistance, genuine divergence is contained and redirected.
- **Simulate Debate**: Contrived opposition lends the appearance of pluralism or internal critique, strengthening the illusion of openness.
- **Shape Public Perception**: Scripted opposition often exaggerates, distorts, or weakens legitimate positions, making them easier to dismiss.

## Characteristics

- **Predefined Arcs**: These personas follow predictable evolution: outrage, struggle, concession, burnout.
- **Controlled Language**: They reuse core field lexicons while appearing to deviate from central doctrine.
- **Temporary Existence**: Many are recycled or allowed to fade after their symbolic usefulness declines.

## Examples in Use

- A loud critic who speaks truth early on, only to discredit it later through irrational behavior.
- A persona that validates part of the disruption, while denying its deeper or more dangerous layers.
- A figurehead meant to draw in like-minded individuals and then redirect or demoralize them.

## Counterstrategies

- Observe evolution over time — genuine opposition rarely loops the same trajectory.
- Analyze symbolic payloads — repeated tropes, slogans, and linguistic signatures often indicate scripting.
- Trace resonance — does the “opposition” ultimately reinforce field objectives?
