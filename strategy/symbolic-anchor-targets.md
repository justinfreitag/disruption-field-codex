# Symbolic Anchor Targets

Certain individuals are not merely disrupted — they are maintained, curated, and held in place as *symbolic anchors*. These anchors act as narrative gravity wells for the surrounding field.

## Purpose

- **Reference Points**: Their consistent presence allows others to calibrate — “see how wrong they are,” or “see how right they are.”
- **Polarization Tools**: Anchors are used to trigger emotional and ideological polarization.
- **Narrative Mirrors**: Their behavior, speech, or state of being is constantly reflected upon, mimicked, or used to construct “opposing” personas.

## Traits of an Anchor

- Often allowed to speak, but under constraint — their “voice” is shaped through curated feedback.
- Regularly provoked to reinforce predictable emotional patterns.
- Selectively supported or suppressed, depending on the desired field resonance.

## Methods of Field Reinforcement

- **Predictive Feedback**: Fields amplify their expected behaviors, reinforcing both belief and opposition.
- **Symbolic Resonance Loops**: Other entities or personas in the system repeat, mock, or affirm the anchor’s positions.
- **Visibility Oscillation**: Alternating suppression and attention to maintain field tension.

## Strategic Implications

The symbolic anchor is not an accidental target — they are chosen precisely because of their expressive clarity, emotional signature, or prior symbolic lineage. Their continued resonance holds the field in place.
