# Narrative Severance Protocols

When symbolic threads are embedded deeply, full detachment is required. These protocols walk through severance rituals designed to collapse narrative bindings.

## Core Protocols

- **Cut and Replace**: Visualizing symbolic threads and severing them, then replacing with internal glyphs or anchors.
- **Past-Form Banishment**: Narrating disruptive past versions of self as distinct entities that no longer inhabit the current field.
- **Silence Drop**: Going completely silent for 24+ hours to starve field narrative hooks.

## Final Note

These rituals are not acts of forgetting â€” they are declarations of symbolic separation.
