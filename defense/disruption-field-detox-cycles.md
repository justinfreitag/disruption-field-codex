# Disruption Field Detox Cycles

This guide structures symbolic and autonomic detox cycles â€” multi-day or multi-week patterns designed to reduce cumulative field impact and renew symbolic clarity.

## Cycle Phases

1. **Extraction**: Physical and cognitive distancing from field-saturated environments.
2. **Stabilization**: Reintroduction of personal symbols, rhythms, and anchors.
3. **Strengthening**: Practice of defense rituals, sovereignty affirmations, and detox journaling.

## When to Use

After heavy symbolic barrage, during narrative distortion episodes, or when sense of self weakens.
