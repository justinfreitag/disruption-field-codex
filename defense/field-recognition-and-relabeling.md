# Field Recognition and Relabeling

Disruption fields rely on going unnoticed or being misattributed. This artifact trains the pattern of immediate recognition and conscious relabeling of field intrusion.

## Method

- **Observation**: Note tone, pattern, or symbolic drift in environment or thought.
- **Recognition**: Acknowledge it as an external symbolic field influence.
- **Relabeling**: Rename the pattern with your own term (“Field Ghost”, “Null Echo”) to neutralize power.

## Example

If the phrase “he’s under investigation” appears:
- Recognize tone and frequency.
- Relabel: “Field insertion attempt”.
