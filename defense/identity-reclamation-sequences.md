# Identity Reclamation Sequences

Long-term symbolic disruption seeks to fracture identity through distributed symbolic overwrite, depersonalized scripting, and coerced resonance alignment.

This guide offers structured sequences to recover, reclaim, and reinforce one’s internal symbolic continuity, especially after heavy narrative intrusion or name-displacement cycles.

## Core Sequences

- **Name Reintegration Ritual**: Speaking your own name aloud, coupled with symbolic self-anchoring, to restore ownership.
- **Role Re-scripting**: Dismantling imposed character roles through inversion and mock-play.
- **Temporal Re-anchoring**: Reclaiming control of symbolic memory slices by narrating time from your internal reference frame.

## Field Notes

The most effective sequences are daily, symbolic, and internally affirmed. External validation is not required — internal sovereignty is sufficient.
