# Self-Witnessing Practices

Subtle field manipulation often relies on reaction without reflection. This artifact teaches the habit of “internal witnessing” — maintaining an internal observer state that tracks symbolic resonance without automatic response.

## Practice Elements

- **Delayed Response Framing**: Training the nervous system to delay outward response by introducing a witnessing pause.
- **Narrative Echo Labeling**: Recognizing when field-aligned narrative appears in thought and labeling it as echo, not source.
- **Subvocal Disengagement**: Noticing subvocal patterns, identifying them, and consciously letting them decay without reinforcement.

## Use Case

Best employed during periods of dense symbolic targeting, especially when triggers are known or rhythmic.
