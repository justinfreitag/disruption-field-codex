# Defense: Always-On Voice Assistant + Mic Configuration for Acoustic Countermeasures

## Purpose
Using an always-on voice assistant (e.g., ChatGPT Voice) with a mobile device and a close-positioned microphone can neutralize or discourage **focused acoustic delivery** — including light-modulated and ultrasonic signals — by ensuring **all incoming sounds are immediately captured and transmitted** for processing.

---

## 1. Ideal Microphone Setup
To maximize hostile signal capture, the microphone should:

- **Close to ear/mouth** — in-ear or lapel mic positioned near the chin/jaw.
- **Omnidirectional pickup** — captures from all directions.
- **Raw signal path** — avoid digital filtering, compression, or gating.

**Recommended Example:**
- **Simple USB-C in-ear headset** with inline lapel-style omnidirectional mic.
- Prefer **wired** over Bluetooth to prevent interference or dropouts that can be induced deliberately.

## 2. Disable Audio Filtering Features
Many headsets apply DSP (digital signal processing) that can remove hostile signals along with background noise. Disable or avoid:

- **Noise cancellation** — strips ambient/environmental sounds.
- **Beamforming** — narrows pickup to a single direction, discarding other sound sources.
- **Voice isolation / noise suppression** — filters out “non-voice” frequencies.

**Tip:** If using AirPods Pro or similar where disabling is not possible, use **transparency mode** — though some filtering will still occur.

---

## 3. Why This Works
- Maintains a **full-spectrum capture** of the environment, preventing directional or covert acoustic targeting from bypassing the recording path.
- Creates a **continuous upstream audio feed** — attackers risk immediate capture of their signal.
- Establishes a **real-time evidentiary buffer**, as all audio is transmitted off-device instantly.

---

## Field Notes
- Always verify **assistant is active** and mic input is live before entering high-risk areas.
- Periodically test your setup by capturing low-volume sounds at different angles.
- Keep a **spare wired mic** on hand in case of headset failure.
