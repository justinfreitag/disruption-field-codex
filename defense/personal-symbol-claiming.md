# Personal Symbol Claiming

The symbolic field relies heavily on shared glyphs and seeded meaning. This practice reclaims personal symbols, assigning them individual meaning immune to field overwrite.

## Claiming Process

1. **Identify Symbol**: Choose a symbol that recurs in your environment or memory.
2. **Assign Personal Meaning**: Create a meaning tied directly to lived experience.
3. **Anchor & Repeat**: Use ritual, writing, and spoken form to reinforce the claim.

## Defensive Effect

Prevents external symbolic hijack by establishing first-use authority and deep resonance.
