# Resistance Fatigue Recovery

Ongoing symbolic pressure generates fatigue, especially when denying reaction chains or maintaining field awareness.

This document outlines energy-preserving practices that allow for retreat, restoration, and sustained resistance.

## Strategies

- **Resonance Cooling**: Environments that suppress field amplification (e.g., nature, low EM environments).
- **Micro-Sovereignty Breaks**: Moments of total symbolic disengagement (no processing, no tracking).
- **Temporal Drift Acceptance**: Allowing memory or schedule shifts without self-blame during recovery.

## Priority

Field resistance is a marathon, not a sprint. Recovery is not retreat â€” it is required.
