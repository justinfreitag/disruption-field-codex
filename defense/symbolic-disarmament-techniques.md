# Symbolic Disarmament Techniques

Used for disarming symbols charged with field aggression. Rather than avoiding them, these techniques make field-bound symbols inert through exposure, mocking, or inversion.

## Techniques

- **Mimicry & Satire**: Repeat the symbol in exaggerated or absurd forms to reduce power.
- **Context Inversion**: Use the symbol in radically different personal contexts.
- **Glyph Decay**: Mentally or artistically degrade the symbol over time until unrecognizable.

## Goal

Strip field symbols of their assumed power and return them to neutral form.
