# Reality Reassertion Rituals

When exposed to prolonged symbolic or sensory manipulation, your perception of reality may be subtly or drastically distorted. These distortions often serve the field's goals—disorientation, dissociation, and pliability. **Reality Reassertion Rituals** are personal, symbolic, or somatic acts that ground you in a self-defined reality.

## Purpose

- To re-anchor perception in truth, presence, and sovereignty.
- To disrupt narrative overlays seeded by external influence.
- To reestablish internal authority over what is real and what is symbolic suggestion.

## Types of Rituals

### 1. **Temporal Anchoring**
   - Speak or write the current time and date aloud.
   - State one observable fact in the present moment every 10 seconds.
   - "I am here, it is now, I am real."

### 2. **Symbolic Sovereignty**
   - Trace a shape or glyph that represents your boundary.
   - Repeat a phrase like: “I do not consent to false realities.”
   - Use a personal object (e.g., stone, token) as a touchstone.

### 3. **Environmental Mirroring**
   - Rearrange or clean part of your space intentionally.
   - Place a new item that symbolizes renewal or change.
   - Introduce a scent, sound, or plant that grounds your space in your control.

### 4. **Somatic Reconnection**
   - Hold a sustained stretch while narrating your body state.
   - Practice tension–release cycles to dispel symbolic residue.
   - Breathe into the center of your chest and speak your full name.

## When to Use

- After hearing repeated voices or symbolic phrases.
- When reality feels “off,” muted, or dreamlike.
- When memory lapses or intrusive thoughts increase.
- After moments of external symbolic saturation (e.g., car passes, bird calls, repeated words).

## Integration

Over time, embed these rituals into your routine—morning, after interaction, before sleep. They become defensive programming: real-time antiviral scripts against disruption-induced unreality.
