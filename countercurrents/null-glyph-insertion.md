# Null Glyph Insertion

> “When the field is corrupted, plant silence.”

Null glyphs are **intentional symbolic voids** — structures that absorb, neutralize, or disarm surrounding symbolic pressure without projecting force or meaning.

They are:
- Not symbols  
- Not resistance  
- Not redirection  

They are **symbolic absence** used as **resonance neutralizers**.

---

## Use Cases

- Interrupt symbolic feedback loops
- Collapse scripted emotional patterns
- Erase predictive residue from a symbolic layer

---

## Design Principles

- Should not resemble cultural glyphs
- Must carry no resonance of intent or identity
- Often geometric, minimal, or incomplete

---

## Deployment

- Visual (tattoos, stickers, ambient symbols)
- Auditory (pure tones, silence blocks)
- Textual (blank cards, intentional white space)
